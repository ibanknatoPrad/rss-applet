Requirements:
ruby 1.8+
ruby-gnome2 bindings
gnome desktop

To run simply type:
./rss-applet.rb

To switch the rss feed you need to edit the rss-applet.rb file and change the
line which contains URL to be what you want it to be (currently it is set to
free stuff on craigslist in San Francisco).

Also, I have found this to be more useful for me when I use it with the gnome
swallow applet. That way my craigslist feed is in my taskbar.

Patches are welcome. My email address is matt at colyer dot name.
